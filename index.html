Without a kid by their side, they tend to blend in with the rest of the School of General Studies student body to which most of them belong. They take the same classes as other students, chase the same deadlines, and walk the same hallways—but it’s their family lives, child care responsibilities, and sheer determination to juggle raising a family while pursuing a degree that largely go unseen. Their experiences are marked by love and perseverance, but also by some of the most grueling schedules in the undergraduate body. Balancing lectures and school lunches, finals and high fevers, these students live in a constant state of negotiation between being a good parent and a good student. </p> <p class="paragraph"> According to a University spokesperson, approximately 125 students identified as parents in a 2023 student survey conducted by the School of General Studies. While Columbia offers some forms of tailored support such as child care discounts, emergency housing, and academic accommodations, many student-parents find that these resources are difficult to access and tend to be reactive rather than proactive. With a lack of infrastructure designed to anticipate their needs, similar crises repeat themselves from one family to the next, whether it be mental health struggles or difficulty finding housing. In the absence of centralized, easy-to-find resources, many rely on luck, personal advocacy, or informal networks found through word of mouth. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The Eye spoke with four of these parents, offering a glimpse into the resilience required to navigate this path and the cracks in the system that make that level of resilience necessary. </p> <p class="dinkus"> *** </p> </div> </section>  <section class="sticky-wrapper"> <div class="sticky-image"> <div id="sticky-img-frame" class="sticky-img-frame"></div> <div id="photo-credit-left" class="left photo-credit"></div> <div id="photo-credit-right" class="photo-credit right"></div> </div> <div class="sticky-content"> <div class="profile-text-block step" data-image="jotera" data-color="#2A9D8F"> <p class="name">Jotera Webster</p> <p>Like many at Columbia, Jotera Webster, a second-year General Studies student, had always dreamed of the Ivy League. For years, she put that dream on hold in order to start a family and allow her husband to get ahead in his career. </p> <p>By 2023, the couple had decided it was her turn. Living in a rural community outside of Pittsburgh, Webster applied and was admitted to several colleges in New York City, including Columbia. The decision was an easy one for Webster, who felt drawn to the diversity of Columbia and its School of General Studies. </p> <p>“You can come back as a parent and not be in a school that’s separated from the general population, but be able to take courses with everyone like a traditional student. So that was a selling point for me,” Webster explained. </p> <p> Webster was slated to start at Columbia in the fall of 2023 when her husband unexpectedly passed away that August. In the throes of grief, Webster opted to defer until the spring. Come 2024, she arrived in the city with her kids and the drive to start a career to create a better life for them. </p> <p> “His death put so many things in perspective for me, just financially,” Webster said. The goal before his death, she said, had been for her to have her own career so the two of them could build something together. “Now that it’s just me, it’s even more responsibility for me to finish and make sure I do something that’s not only meaningful, but that will help provide the life that I wanna give them.” </p> <p>The relocation was quite a shock for a number of reasons. Before she could settle into Columbia as a student, Webster had to navigate the far more urgent challenge of finding a place for her and her kids to live. </p> <p> Although the School of General Studies cannot guarantee housing for all students, when Webster was first admitted, she said she was encouraged by admissions staff that finding housing would not be too difficult, given her priority status as a student with children. However, as she told me, that did not turn out to be the case. Despite the efforts of staff, Webster said that Columbia could not secure housing for her family, and she and her children began the year homeless. </p> <p> For eleven months, Webster and her four children lived in a shelter in Midtown Manhattan. It was a dramatic change from the comfortable, suburban lifestyle the family was used to back home, and one that they were forced to adapt to as they continued to grieve the loss of their husband and father. </p> <p> To make matters worse, the shelter had no Wi-Fi for Webster to complete her homework. She juggled classes and finals without it, commuting daily between campus and the shelter to finish and submit assignments on time. </p> <p> “I would drop my daughter off at day care, come on campus early before my class to try to hurry up, get whatever assignment I need to get finished and submitted on time so that I wouldn’t fall behind.” </p> <p> With housing unavailable through Columbia, Webster turned to the rental market. But trying to rent an apartment in New York City brought its own set of roadblocks. Manhattan is one of the most competitive rental markets, with the median rent hitting $4,500 this year. To make matters worse, Webster described facing stigma as a Black single mother. </p> <p> “I am undesirable as a tenant because I’m Black, I’m a woman, and I have children,” she explained. “So automatically, those are three things that they check off for no.” </p> <p> It wasn’t until she happened to meet Humberto Romero-Gonzalez—General Studies senior and leader of the Equality for GS movement—that things shifted. He helped her write a letter to the dean of General Studies outlining her circumstances, and within days, she was offered a two-bedroom apartment through Columbia’s graduate housing system. The space is modest, Webster said—a small two-bedroom, sixth-floor walk-up. Her two eldest share one bedroom, while the two youngest sleep in bunk beds in the other; Webster shares the bottom bunk with her youngest child. </p> <p> “I’m grateful regardless,” she said of the new space. “It’s better than being at the shelter with rats and roaches and every unimaginable thing you can think of.” </p> <p> According to a <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/04/10/general-studies-student-survey-highlights-financial-aid-struggles/#:~:text=The%20data%20showed%20GPA%20declines%20for%20students%20experiencing%20housing%20and%20food%20insecurity.&text=The%202023%20General%20Studies%20Student,by%20the%20time%20they%20graduate.">Spectator report</a> on the 2023 General Studies Student Survey, housing insecurity is high among General Studies students, with 53 percent of respondents reporting some form of housing insecurity in the 12 months preceding the survey. Four percent reported experiencing homelessness. </p> <p> Although things worked out in the end, Webster wishes there had been more transparency around the issue so they could have avoided the situation altogether. </p> <p> “I think there’s a little bit of miscommunication in the information that you receive versus when you get here,” Webster explained. </p> <p> With her family now safely housed, Webster can direct more attention to her studies. But the grief of losing her husband still lingers. </p> <p> “We all have experienced trauma, and grief has been our biggest struggle,” Webster said of her family. She and several of her kids are in counseling, but both the grief and the everyday concerns of parenthood make her ability to focus and retain information a daily struggle. This, she said, has led to a noticeable drop in her test performance compared to when she was not a parent​. </p> <p> “As a parent, you’re not just thinking about yourself,” Webster explained. “You’re constantly thinking about your kids and ‘what ifs.’ So it’s like my mind doesn’t rest enough.” </p> <p> Despite the toll parenting duties can put on Webster’s focus, she says she draws a great amount of strength from her children, whose adaptability has helped the family through some of their hardest moments. While she often worries about how the upheaval has affected them, their resilience and enthusiasm for their new life in the city have become a source of encouragement. </p> <p> “They actually don’t want to leave,” Webster said. “I considered leaving. They don’t want to go. They’re like, ‘No, let’s stay here and stick it out.’ And you know, ‘it’s fine if I don’t have my own room right now.’ They’re willing to sacrifice with me so that I can finish school.” </p> </div> <div class="profile-text-block step" data-image="vien" data-color="#E9C46A"> <p class="name">Vien Nguyen</p> <p>Vien Nguyen’s days are marked by early alarms and stolen scraps of study time. A General Studies second-year neuroscience major, military veteran, husband, and father, Nguyen often begins his days at 3 or 4 a.m., in order to get some study hours in before his toddler Monty wakes up. He keeps a coffee on his nightstand, ready to chug the moment his alarm goes off. </p> <p>“I know how the chemistry of coffee works,” Nguyen explained, alluding to his neuroscience background. “So I go back to sleep for 20 minutes and then, ‘Alright, I’m up, I gotta do some work.’ If that doesn’t work, I—you know, I sound like a psycho, but I go and take a really cold shower to force me to wake up. It’s like, ‘Okay, okay, you gotta do this.’” </p> <p>The amount of studying Nguyen is able to get in largely depends on how long his son sleeps, but, like any student-parent, it can also be disrupted on any given day by the unexpected.</p> <p>The week before we spoke, Nguyen had lost six hours of class and study time taking Monty to the doctor across town—an expensive loss for someone who is already strapped for time. Nguyen described studying as a new parent as a constant, sleep-deprived game of catch-up, with precious minutes stolen in the car waiting for street sweeping, or after his son has been put to bed. Professors tend to be understanding and willing to make accommodations, he says, but the constant strain to keep up with the material can be draining. </p> <p> “I am not this intuitively smart guy like some of my classmates are. I have to work really, really hard to understand the material,” Nguyen said. “And that takes a lot of grit and a lot of purpose.” </p> <p> Nguyen feels a strong sense of responsibility to succeed for his family. This, he explained, means not understanding the course material is not an option. The work required to keep up or catch up often means sacrificing sleep—but it also means sacrificing time with his son. The two spend time together in the evenings after school, when Monty grabs his hand and leads him to play until bedtime. Still, there are many moments Nguyen feels he is missing out, whether it’s seeing videos of Monty’s latest milestone captured by his wife or goodbye kisses in the morning. </p> <p> “If he’s mad, he’ll like, refuse the kiss, and then he’ll try to follow me out the door and stuff, and then you can hear him cry,” Nguyen described. </p> <p> All these sacrifices raise the stakes of doing well academically for Nguyen. It’s not just about the ego boost of a good grade or high GPA—it’s about whether the long nights and the missed time with Monty will someday be worth it. Adding to those stakes for Nguyen is the knowledge that his wife has also borne a heavy share of the cost, taking on the bulk of daily child care while keeping up with her own full-time, remote job. </p> <p> With both him and his wife sacrificing so much to support his education, there is little room for missteps and even less for failure​. </p> <p> “It motivates me in a way. Not like ‘I can do it’—it’s more like, ‘You can’t fail.’” Nguyen explained. “There’s been moments where I have like, mental crises where, you know—I go to my professors begging, like, ‘What can I do? I’m failing your class.’” </p> <p> The couple is hoping to get Monty into child care soon to ease some of the strain, but arranging that has been difficult. Not only can prices be tremendously expensive in New York City, with the average cost of child care centers ringing in at $26,000 a year, but the application process for getting into those centers, Nguyen said, can feel as competitive as applying to an Ivy League school. </p> <p> Columbia does have a collection of resources to help with securing child care, including discounted rates for Columbia-affiliated programs. But those resources are not well-publicized, Nguyen said, and he and his wife only found out about them through word of mouth. </p> <p> “My wife had to talk to another spouse at the park, and she found some super secret email with a super secret person that gave us all the resources for day care,” Nguyen said. “But that’s not openly advertised.” </p> <p> Nguyen explained that, in general, accessing resources often feels like a scavenger hunt—one that relies on informal networks, just like his wife’s chance meeting at the park. </p> <p> The School of General Studies Childcare and Family Support web page hosts some information on child care and breastfeeding. It also directs student-parents to a group called CU Family Support Network—a “student-led University-wide organization focused on advocating for improved resources and policies to support members of the Columbia community with families.” </p> <p> However, that group has been mostly inactive for several years and was recently derecognized by the University, according to a University spokesperson. While efforts have been made both by students and GS Student Life to revive the group or start a new one, those efforts have yet to reach fruition, the spokesperson added. </p> <p> “These resources are there, it just can be difficult to find. And if you do find them, these can be difficult to still get. That’s the hard part,” Nguyen said. “I feel like there needs to be a more centralized page on the Columbia website for this.” </p> <p> Having missed a previous cutoff date, Nguyen and his wife are waiting until the summer to get Monty enrolled in preschool for the fall—a milestone that, in small and unexpected ways, is already showing up at home. </p> <p> “My son is in that phase where he mimics stuff,” Nguyen said. “My wife sent me a Snapchat of him putting a backpack on, because he always sees me putting my backpack on.” It’s a bittersweet moment, Nguyen said. “It’s really cute, but also, it kind of hurts seeing, like—because when he knows that I have my backpack on, he knows I’m about to leave.” </p> </div> <div class="profile-text-block step" data-image="malky" data-color="#F4A261"> <p class="name">Malky Schwartz</p> <p>For Malky Schwartz—a psychology major at General Studies set to graduate in fall 2026—just making it to class is a feat of logistics. A mother of seven, she commutes nearly two hours on public transit from her town in upstate New York. Schwartz only attends Columbia one day a week—a schedule she strategically condensed into a single day of back-to-back seminars to accommodate her parenting duties. </p> <p>“I choose my classes according to my schedule. And it’s sad because there’s so many good classes I would love to, but it’s impossible,” she told me.</p> <p>Back home, her life is no less demanding. She keeps the house running, manages mealtimes and bedtime for her three youngest, ferries them to doctor’s appointments, cares for her widowed mother, and helps her daughter with homework—all while trying to finish her own.</p> <p>“I can barely keep up with the workload,” she admitted. “I’m chronically missing sleep—been failing taking care of myself, of my body.” Schwartz said she feels lucky if she gets five minutes for a shower, “But I know how important it is, so I cherish those five minutes and I make it count.”</p> <p>As a Hasidic Jewish woman in a devout community where Schwartz said higher education is often frowned upon, she did not grow up with a typical American high school education. </p> <p>“The curriculum in schools are very much censored—mostly religious studies, some basic math, basic vocabulary, basic grammar, basic history. That was all,” she said.</p> <p>After high school, Schwartz got married and immersed herself in starting a family. It was a near-death experience years later, giving birth to her seventh child, that sparked a desire in her to break with tradition and return to academics. </p> <p>“That shook me and woke me up, like, ‘what am I doing with my life?’” Schwartz recalled. “I’ve always wanted to do something bigger. I always dreamed of being a doctor, and how can I even incorporate that? It’s not even possible. But I know I have to, because being a mother—as beautiful and fulfilling as it is, I felt I could do more.” </p> <p>In spring of 2021, Schwartz enrolled in Rockland Community College in Suffern, New York where she obtained both her High School Equivalency and an Associate in Science. It was there that she was first exposed to “the real sciences” and discovered a love for them. </p> <p>“I was the little kid in the candy store,” Schwartz said. “Seeing the periodic table and how it all made so much sense. Like, I’d never seen it before.” </p> <p>Amid her strenuous schedule caring for family and attending classes, it’s that thirst for knowledge that keeps Schwartz driven. It’s very stressful, she said, but whenever she finds herself complaining, she reminds herself this is what she’s always wanted. </p> <p>“I am so privileged to just be studying and learning, and I’m so, so grateful for every moment. I love learning, and I love sitting in a classroom. And I just, I can’t thank my professors enough.” </p> <p>Despite her husband signing off on the endeavor, Schwartz’s studies do challenge educational norms in her community. Her dream of becoming a doctor is considered particularly “outlandish” for a woman in her community, she said. </p> <p>Schwartz spoke openly about the effect this has on her family as well as her husband, as it sets them apart from many others in their community. </p> <p>“I know how hard it is for him because of the stigma of the community. And he really wants to uphold this, you know, picture-perfect family, where his wife is a devout homemaker, and I’ve shattered that dream of his.” </p> <p>Schwartz’s studies have meant making certain sacrifices at home. She often feels a sense of guilt for rushing through bedtimes, asking her husband to take on new responsibilities, or missing moments with her kids. </p> <p>“I feel obligated to make up for the time that I’m a student,” she said. “Which is pretty ironic and sad at the same time, because I’m overcompensating instead of giving myself the grace now I’m a student.” </p> <p>Schwartz said she prioritizes having at least two hours around dinner time where she puts school out of mind so she can be fully present with her family—serving dinner, sitting with everyone, listening to her kids’ stories. Bedtime has gotten easier to juggle as her two youngest boys have gotten older and more self-sufficient, but Schwartz ponders if she should be doing more. </p> <p>“I could improve in that aspect, because bedtime should be only bedtime,” Schwartz reflected. “But I feel like they’re so much older, and I’ve taken advantage of the fact that they don’t need me as much.” </p> <p>Sacrifices have come in the academic sphere as well. Medical school has always been the dream for Schwartz, but she was forced to give that dream up, at least for now, because incorporating premed courses into her schedule has proved impossible.</p> <p>“I was trying to sign up for the chemistry sequence and the lab schedule was so unrelenting, it was impossible for a parent to enroll in those classes,” Schwartz explained, citing the multiple labs, lectures, and discussion sections that would have had her on campus four days a week in the afternoon—time usually spent welcoming her kids home from school and prepping dinner. </p> <p>After speaking with an advisor and failing several semesters in a row to work General Chemistry into her schedule, Schwartz ultimately realized the medical school prerequisites would just not be possible to fulfill during her degree. </p> <p>“It was my biggest disappointment in my life,” Schwartz reflected. </p> <p>Schwartz remains hopeful that one day, when her kids are older, she might be able to make it happen, but until then, she’s focused on finishing her degree. Despite her disappointment, she hopes her studies will inspire her children and dreams of one day bringing them to campus. She’s uncertain if that will ever happen—while her younger children admire her drive to study, the older ones find it harder to understand. </p> <p>But this is one dream she refuses to let go of. </p> <p>“Being that I’m from a community where higher education is wild, I think that I’m opening up a lot of nuances into my kids’ life, which they would maybe, hopefully one day get to make their own decisions,” she said. “And maybe I’m paving the way for them, taking away the stigma against higher education.” </p> </div> <div class="profile-text-block step" data-image="david" data-color="#E76F51"> <p class="name">David Benson</p> <p>David Benson, a General Studies data science major and father of two, has been studying part-time at Columbia since 2018 in order to maintain his full-time job as head of product security architecture at Bloomberg L.P. He is set to graduate in spring of 2026. </p> <p>Although Benson has a well-paying position, having entered the workforce soon after high school, he felt he had reached the limit of how far he could rise in the company without a bachelor’s degree. Wanting to ensure his future in the field as it evolves, Benson enrolled at Columbia. But balancing a demanding full-time job, rigorous academic study, and parenting duties has proven to be quite the challenge. </p> <p>Back in the spring of 2022, he and his wife had their first child, Gwen. Soon after his daughter was born, in the throes of sleep deprivation, Benson began experiencing panic attacks for the first time in his life. </p> <p>“As any new parent, you are sleeping one to three hours a night. It’s horrible. And I could not—I could not handle the course load,” he said. </p> <p>As Benson’s mental health worsened, he reached out to his advisor and was able to drop a class despite having passed the add/drop period. Columbia swung into action by refunding the course and removing it from his transcript. While this was helpful, Benson pointed out the reactive nature of that support, which fails to prevent students from reaching a breaking point in the first place. </p> <p>“When shit hits the fan, Columbia has resources there and they help,” he said. “Up to that point, you’re on your own. It’s like something terrible has to happen.” </p> <p>With his second child, Leo, only nine months old, sleep deprivation continues to weigh heavily on Benson, inhibiting his ability to focus or retain information. </p> <p>“I once had a stat professor berate me and several others in the class for not being able to regurgitate off the top of my head some basic formula,” he said. “And I’m thinking, in the back of my head like, ‘I haven’t slept more than three hours for the last month.’” </p> <p>As someone who lives with post-traumatic stress disorder, Benson has made use of Columbia’s Counseling and Psychological Services and found them similarly limited, as they were not able to provide the weekly sessions that they recommended to him. </p> <p>According to a University spokesperson, students who require frequent sessions may be referred to an off-campus provider or a Columbia telehealth partner, dependent on their situation. They also noted social workers are available to provide guidance in finding an off-campus provider. “While there is no specific, pre-set limit on the number of sessions at CPS, services are focused on short-term care,” the spokesperson wrote in a comment to The Eye. </p> <p>Fortunately, Benson was able to continue sessions privately by staying in touch with a departing Columbia therapist. </p> <p>“It’s one of the things where, if I didn’t have that, I would have to struggle through this on my own, and I don’t know where I would be.” </p> <p>Struggling alone is a very real problem for student-parents whose over-packed schedules often mean less time on campus, low social engagement, and little—if any—community. This was something Benson felt very acutely. </p> <p> “I think what’s really difficult is it feels incredibly isolating at times, because I don’t get to be on campus so much. I don’t get to build community.” </p> <p> Benson recalled getting an email from organizers trying to set up a new support group for student parents after CU Family Support Network became inactive. Although the group has yet to materialize, even just knowing there are other student-parents out there has given Benson a small sense of relief. </p> <p>“It’s nice to have the idea that that community is there. But here I am, you know, at the end of my time here, almost eight years in, and this is the first time I’ve had that.” </p> <p>The stakes of isolation are high for student-parents for whom isolation is not just an emotional burden, but something that directly impacts their ability to navigate Columbia’s resources. </p> <p>As Benson and several other student-parents noted, even when resources technically exist, the burden of finding them often falls on them as individuals. Without the visibility of a centralized system, many are left to rely on informal networks through word of mouth—meaning that lack of community can be particularly damaging. </p> <p>“If Columbia is going to continue to have students—non-traditional students, especially some that are parents—it has to be a proactive resourcing there for them. It can’t always be reactive, the way it is.” </p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </div> </div> </section> <section class="intro-section" data-color="#264653"> <div class="g-body"> <p class="dinkus"> *** </p> <p class="paragraph"> As Benson and I neared the end of our interview, he asked me a question which I’ve come to see as emblematic of many aspects of the student-parent experience at Columbia. </p> <p class="paragraph"> “What’s the general sense that you get?” He asked, referring to my interviews with other student-parents thus far. “Do they also feel that there are just not resources for them? Do they feel—they feel like they’re drowning?” </p> <p class="paragraph"> Each of these student-parents has pushed forward not in spite of their families, but because of them. Yet that perseverance often comes at a steep cost: to their health, their security, their dreams, or their sense of belonging on campus. Columbia’s current supports, while meaningful in moments of crisis, often seem to serve as Band-Aids rather than building blocks—isolated fixes rather than sustainable infrastructure. </p> <p class="paragraph"> For Webster, there are moments when it feels like too much—when the grief, the pressure, and the exhaustion threaten to take over. </p> <p class="paragraph"> “There’s times where I’m like, I just wanna quit,” she admitted. “I wanna give up. I just wanna, like, go back to Maryland or Pittsburgh and just forget getting this degree and just get a basic job that I’m not happy at, like everybody else in America, right?” </p> <p class="paragraph"> But each time, her children talk her out of it. </p> <p class="paragraph"> “They’re like, ‘No, no mom, you gotta see this through.’ And their dad would have wanted me to finish too,” Webster reflected. “So that’s the other reason why I do it. Because he didn’t like me giving up.” </p> <p class="paragraph"> <em>Eye Senior Staff Writer Morgan Desfosses can be contacted at <a href="mailto:morgan.desfosses@columbiaspectator.com">morgan.desfosses@columbiaspectator.com</a>.</em> </p> <p class="paragraph"> <em>Deputy Graphics Editor Wilson Zhen can be contacted at <a href="mailto:wilson.zhen@columbiaspectator.com">wilson.zhen@columbiaspectator.com</a>.</em> </p> <p class="paragraph"> <em>Want to keep up with The Eye?
